             <h2>What's up with Jazz</h2>
            <p>Jazz a type of music made up of improvisation, history, rhythms, and other musical complexities. Influenced by African music, Caribbean, and European music influences. To define jazz in simply terms would be putting it to shame, so thats why I've made these pages to explore the different kinds of jazz and the importance of it. Jazz is all about exspressing yourself, that's why improvisation is a key element of jazz. Influences from swing music and the blues gives jazz a groovy sound, as well as giving it emotional weight. The music theory that goes into creating a jazz ensemble is like a long complex math equation, with strange chords and complex harmonies. As well as those harmonies another important aspect to jazz is the collaboration between musicians. Similar to a dance, musicians have to listen, and move in their responses, to create a reaction that preforms beautifully together.    </p>

            <img 2 src="images/fall3.jpeg" alt="harry potter" >
            <p>As the picture above displays, this is a perfect season to have a Harry Potter Marathon! As well as my personal favorite LOTR , trust me its a great time for an adventure. As well as cozy fantastical escapes, there are some good shows worth binging. Such as, the classic hit show f.r.i.e.n.d.s, and Gilmore Girls. If you're into animation, Over The Garden wall is the defintion of fall itself. If you aren't into tv, books are a great option. Cozy up near a window, or a fire place and escape into a novel. Currently I am enjoying, The Shadow of The Wind by Carlos Ruiz Zafon--- a wonderful mystery and adventure. What autumnal media will you be enjoying this season? </p>
