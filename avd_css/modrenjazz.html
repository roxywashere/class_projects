            <h2>Whats New With Jazz</h2>
            <hr>
            <p> The term "modern jazz" is refrencing to a collaboration of sorts that expands over time, styles, and sound. Over decades jazz has changed quite a bit, from swing and big band music that was popular in the 30's to the smooth New Orleans type of sound. Now modern muscians are able to combine all of these great sounds together. With a assortment of intricate melodies and odd time signatures jazz is still here and will be for a long time. The movie below 'Lala Land' plays tribute to jazz and its modern influences.  </p>

            <p>The season of leaves changing colors, the days getting darker, and colder this is fall/autumn. Also known as the more popular season, but how can we take advantage of this cozy season? Well  here's a few of my ideas... grab a book and go to your favorite park, people watch, take in the bright colors, and soak in the warm sun. Make a cup of coffee or tea and watch  classic autumnal movies (as listed below). Go out for brunch with your friends and walk around (breaksfast is the best food). Most importantly EXPLORE, WRITE, and ENJOY ART!!! </p>

          <p>Below I mention some modern artist worth checking out. One of my all time favorites is Laufey who has taken inspiration from jazz and her love of classical music to create her own sound. Musicians from the past would be proud of her, she has brought younger generations to love jazz and to apperciate it. Another well known artist is Norah Jones who has deep soulful voice, with hints of that slow classy jazz sound. To continue the theme of ladies, Oliva Dean and Beabadoobee add lovely hints of jazz instruments and rhythms to their songs. Bruno Major, and grentperez do the same thing as those ladies, with their music having hints of jazzy sounds sprinkled in. Other great modern musicians like Justin Hurwitz creates beautiful soundtracks like the one found in Lala Land or Whiplash. This list could continue on, but it is safe to say that maybe your favorite artist has been inspired by jazz. Next time you're listening to music listen closely to the rhythm.    </p>
