            <h2>All about Fall</h2>
            <p>I'm so glad I live in a world where there are Octobers. -Anne of Green Gables</p>
            <p>The season of leaves changing colors, the days getting darker, and colder this is fall/autumn. Also known as the more popular season, but how can we take advantage of this cozy season? Well  here's a few of my ideas... grab a book and go to your favorite park, people watch, take in the bright colors, and soak in the warm sun. Make a cup of coffee or tea and watch  classic autumnal movies (as listed below). Go out for brunch with your friends and walk around (breaksfast is the best food). Most importantly EXPLORE, WRITE, and ENJOY ART!!! </p>
